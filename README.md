## Color Clock

### Description

Color Clock 
This project was inspired by the color clock at http://thecolourclock.co.uk/ and serves to reinforce JS fundamentals with `setInterval`, writing to the DOM, practicing CSS animations, positions, and transforms, and finally breaking down complex problems into simple sequences in code.


The color clock does the following things:

* Every second, it converts the current time to a RGB value color and, converts the RGB value color to a hexadecimal color and sets the background color of the page equal to that color.
* Shows the current time on the page, updating every second using a 24 hour time clock.
* When a user clicks on the time, shows the current hexadecimal code that updates every second.
* When a user clicks on the hexadecimal code, shows the time.
* Shows the time/ hexadecimal code vertically centered and horizontally centered on the page.
